bave placed the Spabim) amito the Stones which I put therein, with the Spawn
sticking to them. These Eggs grow much linger, and therein are bred small
WrmsJ some red and fhme grey 3 which fora while lie mewed up in their
Egg-cafis, but on occafion thrust themselves out half-way, and fi) divert them-
selves by roffi-ng about, and again retire upon any disturbance. When they are⁹
bigger they come quite out, andswim about the Water, and are in all things
like the Worm, Nr. 1. Lr. a. Indeed they are of the very fleme Species. For -
Ifhw one of them this June4. turned to a red Aurelia already spoken of, with
a Top-knot like Dandelion-fhed. From which Aurelia came this very Gnat
in the specimen, Nr. 6. without any Top-knot, as in Nr. 14
I am in great fitspence whether the Worm, Aurelia, or Gnat lays thie
S pawn. I have Spawn laid in one ofmy Glaffis where Gnate were bred 3 which
if laid there by the Gnats, must needs be fiion after they left their Aurelia-state ς
and I think too without any previous Copulation‚ especially with top-knotted
Gnats. Which made me inclined to think it might be laid there hythe me,
or Aurelia. But a carious Gentleman in my Neighbourhood told me, that he
observing one Evening many Gnate sporting themselves near the Brink ofa
Pond, was· curiam to catch stirne of them, and that he obstrved the hinder part ”
of their' Belliee to be wrapped, or doubled up, with a Jelly included. » Whence
be conclu-ded, that the Gnats *were then dropping their Seed into the Waters, for
uture'G-eneration. f ⁷ Ὗ ·’ < ’ ’ < · - ·
s Havingthm fiir given you the History of Gnate, you may justly expe& these¹
Ι should also give 'you an account, what particular Gnate come from t-he Jev'e'-
ral Au'reliae before named. But having not as yet accurately enough observet!
the various fhrts of Gnats (which arc more than two, as the sagae-iota
Leewenhoek, Swammerdam‚ and-others erroneoufly shy) Ι cannot therefore
[ὸ well describe which come from which.' Only Ι -haaeve observed that Gnate
without feathered·Horns‚ come from the Wrms Nr. 1. and those withftather-
ed,· or hrufh-like Horres firom Nr. 3. But whether they do contrariwifi’, Ι can-
not say3 but I believe not, having frequently seen it fii, and never otherwise.
Ι imagine a fitrt ofbig-bellied Gnat to come from the AflreIia, Nr. 2. but whe-
ther with a fhrked Tail (ac in this abortive in the Specimen) Ι have not had
