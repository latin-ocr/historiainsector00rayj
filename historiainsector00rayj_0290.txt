, Retur’n you my hearty thanks for your kind Answe'r to my Letter 3 which
Debt I would have paid before now, but Ι was willing to give you the best
History I could of Gnats, in answer to your Request. But after thus muchDe-
lay, and many careful Obfhrvations3 Ι. find, Ι fhall send you but an imperfecffl
History> 3 their Generation being very various beyond albexpeffation, as Iflnd
by daily new Discoveries. However, be pleafied to accept of the truest· and most·>

compleat Account which as yet I am able to give you. '
The first· thing] fhallspeczk offhall be concerning the Aureliae or Chrysali·-
des of Gnats. Of which those that have fallen under my Observation may be

divided into two Kinds: One without Club—heads, and with Legs 3 the other.- .

with Club-heads5 and without Legs.
Of the firsc’ Kind I never βου but one Species, which I have here enclosed

sent yon a Specimen of, marked (Nr.2. Lr.b.) This Aurelia, besides fix ¹
Legs‚ harh a Tail confisting of three Feathers 3 each of which Feathers hath 3*
Colours in it, viz. the End whitifh5 next blank, and next the Body broma,

like the rest· of the Aurelia's· Bocly. The Head‘is· globose. The Wings lie in '

two Bags on its Back3 above one halfof which-are crisped up, just as Women
double up or crisi) their Limnen when they hem it. The first Aurelia which I
took. of this kind, was in an instant cracked on the Beck, and deserted by its
Gnat3 which fi> fhon fleu) away, that I could not catch it 3 only it left its
Aurelia's Skin ire my Hand. ·

Just by the Aurelia, I have in the specimen placed one of the very Gnats
which came out of s ach another Aurelia, marked Nr. 2. Lr. c: The Gnat was·

. abortive, which 25 the reason it is no better gumm’d to the Paper.
Whence thefh Aureliae came, whether from Worms, or what else, Ι. can’t

say>
